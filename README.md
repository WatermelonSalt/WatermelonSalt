## Silly Me <img align="top" src="./Profile Assets/ridiculous.gif" height="75">

Well, the banner(I'm the one who designed it) above says that I'm **WatermelonSalt682** but the profile says that I'm **WatermelonSalt** and both of them are correct but I go by **WatermelonSalt** on most websites but whatevs <img align="top" src="./Profile Assets/shrug omnom.gif" width="50">

## Not a silly me

<img align="right" src="./Profile Assets/binary4.gif">

Now, I'll stop lecturing you about my silliness and tell you about me

* I basically like learning new things every day
* I like stuff about space and its mysteries
* I am a fun person, I think
* I like programming very much and I love following technology <img src="./Profile Assets/pepe insane type.gif" width="50">
* Maybe I dont type like that insane pepe I've got up there but at a way slower pace at about 35 wpm on average

That's all about me!

## Skills and Skills I suck at

Here comes an interesting part about me!

### I'm good at

* Playing games(An average player)
* Programming, I guess
* Analysing stuff, for the most part
* Organizing Stuff

### I'm not good at

* Non-digital games of any kind, maybe I'm kind of good at Chess(The non-digital one if you prefer)
* Cooking, I tried one time and decided that I can't do that
* Writing comment blocks for code

That's all I could think of and I don't even know if they count as "Skills" but there you have it!

## Know More!

        class World:

                def WatermelonSalt:

                     OS = ["Windows", "Arch/Manjaro"]
                     LANGUAGES = ["Python", "Lua"(No Projects attempted yet)]
                     GOING_TO_LEARN = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "C++", "C#"]
                     TOOLS = ["GIT", "PWSH", "BASH"]
                     QUOTE = "Everyday, learn something new"
                     INTERESTS = ["SPACE", "TECH", "PROGRAMMING", "GAMES"]
                     PERSONALITY = ["FUN", "COOL"]
                ```

The class basically represents the world and the function definition represents me in the world and the variables tell stuff about me
